# Extracting Faces from Images using Python and OpenCV


This project demonstrates a Python script that utilizes the OpenCV library to detect and extract faces from images. It uses a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier to automatically detect human faces within the input image and then extracts them into separate images.

## Features
- Face detection using the Haar cascade classifier from OpenCV.
- Extraction and display of detected faces.


### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/extract-faces-python-opencv.git
```

2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

### Usage
1. Add the image file you want to process to the project folder.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the script `faces.py` with the path to the image file as an argument:
```
python faces.py 
```

4. The script will process the image, detect faces, and display each extracted face in separate windows.

5. To close the windows and end the script, press any key in the terminal.
